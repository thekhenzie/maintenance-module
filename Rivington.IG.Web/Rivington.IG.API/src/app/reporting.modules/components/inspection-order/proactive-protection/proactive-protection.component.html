                The assessments, reports and recommendations regarding changes that should be considered to help 
                protect your property are designed to provide additional protection in the event of wildfire. Even if every
                 recommended step is taken, your property could still be destroyed as wildfire is unpredictable and can be 
                 impossible to stop or control, no matter what mitigation efforts have been undertaken. Spinnaker 
                 Insurance and/or Rivington Partners does not represent or warrant that taking the steps suggested can 
                 or will protect your property from destruction by fire. No warranties or representations of any kind are
