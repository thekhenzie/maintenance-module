    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <b>Replacement Cost Valuation</b> of your home. Our inspector has taken the information gathered from you in our visit,
      combined with observations of the building materials used to construct your home to determine a comprehensive replacement
      cost analysis.

    <p>
      The
      <b>Loss Mitigation Recommendations</b> are a list of actions recommended and/or required to proactively protect your home
      from future losses.

      required actions for you to take, to minimize your risk and keep your home protected.

      It is our hope that this report will help you and your insurance agent to develop a comprehensive plan of protection for
      your home and your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal in providing you with this report is to make recommendations to you, to help you proactively protect your home from
